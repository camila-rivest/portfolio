                <p class="project-page__description project-page__description--above">Shifting Peace represents the serene experience of being in a place that is very dear to me. It combines videos and audio recordings taken from the mostly abandoned freight yard near my house to recreate its calming atmosphere. Hidden from all eyes, it is the only place where I can take long walks and fully let my guard down. This creates a space where I can leave all my worries at the door and simply relax and enjoy the environment around me. With this piece, I wanted to share this emotional experience with the user by allowing them to navigate the space and find the same feelings of peace as I.</p>
                <p class="project-page__description project-page__description--above">A camera records the user, which is used to detect movements in certain areas of the camera footage. When triggered by the user’s movements, each area reveals a different view of the train tracks alongside the sounds associated with it. The user is also invited to change the visual qualities of the footage by rotating a small device.</p>
                <p class="project-page__description">The interaction is meant to be simple and minimalistic. This allows the user to flow between the different locations while staying immersed. To achieve this, movement detection was chosen to make navigation more organic. As for the visual variations, a microcontroller containing an accelerometer monitors its rotation in two axes, which also provides smooth control over the experience.</p>
